## Design

### Colour Scheme

- I used a light greyscale theme for my website introducing colours when you start to play the game

### Typography

- The Montserrat font is the only font used with Arial, Helvetica then Sans Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in design, so it is both attractive and appropriate for the modern memory game design.

### Imagery

- I used solid food icons from Font Awesome to give it a food theme and the icons can be maniplulated in the css to easily change the size or colour as I see fit.
